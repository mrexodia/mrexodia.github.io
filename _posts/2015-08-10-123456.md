Sitting at a camping with a broken toe makes you bored, very bored in fact. So bored I started to look at the camping network structure.

## Scanning the environment

The first thing I noticed was the cameras with a nice little antenna hanging all over the place. In an [old DefCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8DjTcANBx0) I saw the security of most IP cameras was shit, so I decided to give it a shot myself.

The camera model I am currently talking about is the [ELRO C903IP.2](http://www.elro.eu/en/products/cat/security/network-camera/fixed-camera/plug-play-network-camera3). I reversed the firmware of another ELRO camera and it had very similar directory structures and web commands, so I believe it is safe to assume all ELRO cameras are affected.

Because I had no idea of the network layout beforehand I ran a little nmap scan to get the list of online IP addresses in the local subnet:

```
MacBook-Air:~# nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24

```

The thing that struck me was the low addresses after the gateway `192.168.1.1` so I first checked those out. Turned out the lower addresses were DHCP (my MacBook was `192.168.1.4`). I did find a nice open printer though:

## Web authentication gone wrong

After some more checking I found a login screen at `192.168.1.101`. This could be a camera!

![screenshot of IP camera authentication screen](/images/elro2.png)

Trying some default stuff (admin:admin, admin:1234) etc. didn't appear to work, so I just pressed the Cancel button:

![screenshot of IP camera after cancel](/images/elro3.png)

Besides the lack of even a self-signed HTTPS certificate it was obvious that even the login screen had serious security issues. After the initial state of shock I decided to check out the page source code:

![screenshot of IP camera login source code](/images/elro4.png)

`check_user.cgi` appears to be the page generating the HTTP authentication (which is plain text by the way). The page only shows us `401 Unauthorized` and the name and version of the web server `mini_httpd/1.19 19dec2003`. There are some known vulnerabilities for that version, but they had no POC code for reading files so I put that on halt for the time being.

![screenshot of the IP camera 401](/images/elro5.png)

`get_status.cgi` requires no authentication (wtf) and it shows some identifying information like the system version and some other status information

![screenshot of the IP camera status](/images/elro6.png)

Since there were some links on the login page I decided to try and sign in to the camera web interface. Clicking the link and pressing cancel a few times showed the full web interface, but unfortunately the feed was black.

## An unexpected surpise

Trying to click some of the **terrible** popup menus on the left (I had been a few hours on the web interface at this point) gave some more device information (obtained from the `get_status.cgi`), but the P2P menu showed some actually interesting stuff!

![screenshot of the P2P interface in the web interface](/images/elro8.png)

The iframe led me to `p2p.htm`, which contained some GUID, a username and a **password** (you are kidding me right?) Just setting the input type to `text` with the inspector revealed the details in full glory:

![screenshot of the p2p.htm page with password shown](/images/elro9.png)

Checking the source it turns out that `get_tutk_account.cgi` has **no** `.htpasswd` protection which is why it shows the password in the web interface.

![screenshot of get_tutk_account.cgi](/images/elro10.png)

## Theory in practice

Googling for a P2P IP Camera app gives [this nice app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apexis.P2PCAMLIVE) that automatically gets the running cameras:

![screenshot of camera list](/images/elro11.png)

Selecting the right camera and entering the password given by the web interface shows this nice feed by the campfire (notice me walking around with crutches):

The other cameras have the same vulnerability (probably the same model):

## Going for gold

After this serious issue I couldn't get much further with the web interface (just some directory listings, but no directory traversal or anything). I did try to access `.htpasswd` (read something about that for old versions of mini_httpd), but it gave a graceful 403.

Let's try another nmap scan to see what services are running on the device:

```

There is telnet! Trying `telnet 192.168.1.101` asks for a login and password, but at least it is not blocking connections! Not sure how that would work out remotely, but I suspect it would connect just fine.

Trying some of the [worst passwords of 2014](http://splashdata.com/press/worst-passwords-of-2014.htm) it appears to actually be using **the worst password in the world** for root access: `123456`.

```
MacBook-Air:~# telnet 192.168.1.101

# 
```

Some firmware reversing adventures led me to check in the `/mnt/5350` directory (I might write something about that another time):

```
# ls
var     tmp     sbin    mnt     lib     home    etc     bin
usr     sys     proc    media   init    etc_ro  dev
# cd mnt
# ls
pdbmountfs  5350        mtd         bin
test.sh     tmp         nfs
# cd 5350
# ls
mini_httpd.conf    modules            web                etc
user_info          usb_reset_logfile  lib
```

The `user_info` file looks interesting:

```
# cat user_info
admin:1357# 
```

Well, looks like plaintext credentials for the web interface to me. Trying it and it works perfectly fine:

## Final words

So that would be about it for this blogpost. Before I finish I do want to say that this research was done just for fun and no cameras were harmed in the process. Another thing is that **I had access to the local network**. I think that if you isolate these camera's on a separate subnet and make sure they are not accessible from the outside (or only accessible from a fixed IP address with firewall rules in the router) you will be fine.

After this post is published I will send a link to ELRO to inform them about the security issues discussed here. If they release a firmware update to fix these issues I will update this post.

Till next time,

mrexodia
